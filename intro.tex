\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

This thesis explores the Garbage-first family of garbage collectors, including
the underlying relationship among them, the improvements each GC makes and the performance
contribution of each algorithmic component.
My thesis is that different members in Garbage-first family of collectors are strongly related
and that each collector is an improvement over other existing collectors.
Each improvement increases GC performance in some respect but also has drawbacks.

\section{Project Statement}

As the memory size of modern server machines becomes larger, the latency time of
garbage collectors for managed programming languages generally becomes longer.
In this way, the design of low-latency garbage collectors has become
a hot topic today. The aim of these collectors includes reducing the latency of collectors and
performing heap compaction or evacuation to avoid heap fragmentation.

% Current three collectors
Among all the existing low-latency garbage collectors, the category of region-based
collectors is widely explored and used in industry.
Region-based collectors are designed to reach high GC
performance (especially GC pause time) by managing the heap as a set of memory regions.
Four well-known region-based garbage collectors,
Garbage-first GC, Shenandoah GC, C4 GC and ZGC created by
\cite{detlefs2004garbage,flood2016shenandoah,tene2011c4,liden_karlsson_2018} respectively
are high performance region-based garbage collectors implemented for Java Virtual Machines
to achieve a short GC pause time and a high program throughput.

% Problem
The design and implementation of such region-based collectors has been well
explored, but unfortunately, their underlying relationship remains unidentified and unexplored.
Although these collectors share a lot of basic algorithms and structures,
the original papers and other publications describing these collectors only regard them as
newly created and stand-alone collectors instead of improvements over the existing collectors.
Such ignorance of the potential relationships prevents GC designers to have a clear
overview of the algorithms supporting these collectors.

The lack of explorations of these relationships makes GC performance evaluation
and analysis among these collectors difficult.
The collectors are invented by different groups.
The implementations and optimizations employed by these collectors are varied.
This means that the original implementations of the family of collectors do not reflect
their underlying structural relationships.
% The implementation differences among these collectors make them impossible
% to be properly measured for the GC performance impact of each structural component.
This implementation differences make it hard to understood GC performance contribution of each
GC algorithm involved in these collectors.
Also, the lack of explorations on these relationships and the lack of
performance analysis and comparisons may cause some unexpected performance issue to these collectors.
As an example, according to \cite{nguyen2015speculative}, sometimes GC time of region-based collectors
can take up to 50\% of the total execution time of Big Data systems.
On the other hand, this can also mislead the future design of related collectors.

So here comes the problem which this thesis is aimed to solve: What are the relationships
among the G1 family of collectors and in which way do they contribute to GC performance?

% Challenge
% The challenge is: \pending{XXX}?


% As the three major concurrent region-based garbage collectors in OpenJDK, 
% Garbage-First GC and Shenandoah GC share most of their collection policies and techniques.
% Both of these two GCs were designed to deduce latency of mutators on large heaps.
% They share the same heap structure which divides the heap up into regions.
% During GC cycle, both of these two GCs perform similar marking and
% heap compaction processes.
% Although the specific algorithms and implementation details are very, these two
% GCs reveal strong relationships to each other and share plenty of common parts and general ideas.

% These Garbage-First family of garbage collectors were designed to reduce GC latencies,
% their performances sometimes can be unsatisfactory. Sometimes GC time of region-based collectors
% can take up to 50\% of the total execution time of Big Data systems (\cite{briandemsky2015speculative}).
% In this way it is necessary to perform careful analysis of the pros and cons for the 
% Garbage-First family of garbage collectors, especially on an algorithmic level.

% However, analyzing the original implementations of these three garbage
% collectors on OpenJDK is difficult. These three collectors are implemented by
% different teams and do not share too much code among the implementations. Also,
% since Garbage-First is production ready while Shenandoah GC is still provided as an
% experimental GC option in OpenJDK, optimizations among their implementations varies a lot.
% Thus analyzing the original OpenJDK implementations becomes impossible.

% This thesis aims to perform an more careful analysis and comparison among all the 
% Garbage-First family of garbage collectors by implementing these collectors on JikesRVM
% and sharing as much implementation as possible.

\section{Contribution}

I show that this family of collectors be strongly related to each other,
although the original papers of these collectors present them each as a stand-alone collector
instead of an improved collector based on other existing GC algorithms. The lack of
explorations of such structural relationships makes it hard to carefully analyze
the performance contribution caused by each part of the GC algorithm, hence prevents
GC designers from truly understanding the pros and cons of each GC algorithm.

This thesis makes an exploration of the underlying relationship among the
G1 family of garbage collectors. The algorithmic relationships are summarized
as a series of progressive improvements, which generally reflects the evolutionary
history of the G1 family of collectors.

As another major component of the exploration, I implement the collectors by following
the steps of the progressive improvements, starting from a most simple form of the
region-based collector to the most complex collector, e.g. Garbage-first GC and
Shenandoah GC, to reveal the hierarchy of the G1 family of collectors.
I did not implement C4 GC and ZGC due to some platform limitations, which will be
discussed in Chapter~\ref{cha:conc}.
GC performance of these implemented collectors is also evaluated and discussed.

The general steps involved in this thesis for exploring these collectors include:

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Discover the relationships}
    of the G1 family of garbage collectors including understanding the basic algorithms
    of these collectors, inferring the underlying relationships among them and reconsidering them as
    a series of algorithmic improvements instead of individual isolated collectors.

  \textbf{Implement a simple mark-region collector}
    by starting from an existing SemiSpace GC in MMTk and replacing the two copy-spaces
    with a region-space which divides the memory up into multiple regions.
    Then I added an extra marking phase before the evacuation phase.

  \textbf{Perform a series of improvements}
    by starting from the simple mark-region collector and progressively perform
    improvements including linear-scan evacuation, concurrent marking, remembered sets
    and concurrent evacuation. This step produces improved versions of the
    mark-region collectors, the Garbage-first GC and the Shenandoah GC.

  \textbf{Measure GC performance}
    including measuring the GC pause times of all implemented collectors, the 
    concurrency overheads and the remembered set size. These measurements reflect the
    performance gain due to each algorithmic improvement.

  \textbf{Explain and explore the results} which leads to a reconsideration
    of the pros and cons of each G1-related GC algorithm in depth.
\end{quote}

A total of six different Garbage-first family of garbage collectors were implemented to reveal
the relationships among them and demonstrate different kinds of garbage collection
algorithms, such as concurrent marking, remembered-sets, and Brooks barriers.

In order to make a detailed and careful analysis of these collectors and
be able to compare these collectors at an algorithmic level, the implementations
are as close as possible to the design of their original papers.

I measure the GC pause times for each implemented collector, as well as the concurrency
overheads involved in these collectors, including
overhead for concurrent marking, concurrent remembered-set refinements and concurrent evacuation.
I found that concurrent marking contributes to a decrease of the 95 percentile GC pause time by 58.2\%
where linear scanning evacuation increases the GC pause time by 15.8\%.
However, the use of remembered-sets can reduce the GC pause time by 41.9\%,
and concurrent evacuation can also reduce the GC pause time up to 84.1\%
As the result of concurrency overhead analysis, I found that concurrent marking has
an overhead of 22.0\% where Shenandoah GC's concurrent evacuation
has an overhead of 85.5\%.

All works were done in JikesRVM, a research purpose Java Virtual Machine and MMTk
which is a memory management took written in Java \citep{blackburn2004oil}.
