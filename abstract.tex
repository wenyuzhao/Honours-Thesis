The Garbage-First family of garbage collectors, including Garbage-first GC,
Shenandoah GC and ZGC, are region-based concurrent collectors designed for
large heaps to archive lower latency and mutator overhead. However, analysis,
measurements and comparisons between their OpenJDK implementations can be
hard since the implementations do not share too much code and have different
level of optimizations. This article attempts to perform a detailed and
careful analysis of these collectors at an algorithmic level by implementing
them upon the same hierarchy on JikesRVM. We evaluate the footprint overheads,
mutator latency and barrier overheads for these collectors. Our results show
that by using remembered-sets, G1 has \pending{???}\% average footprint overhead
and G1, Shenandoah has barrier overheads of \pending{???}\% and \pending{???}\%
respectively on the DaCapo benchmark suite. We also find that by using Brooks
style indirection pointers, Shenandoah and ZGC has average barrier overheads
of \pending{???}\% and \pending{???}\%. The costs and overheads revealed in these
garbage collectors can help garbage collection algorithm designers to identify
the main advantages and drawbacks of region-based concurrent collectors and
hence have the ability to make further refinements and optimizations to them. In
additon, the relationships this paper discussed in the
